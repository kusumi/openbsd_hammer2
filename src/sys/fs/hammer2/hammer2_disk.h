 * The structures below represent the on-disk media structures for the HAMMER2

 * aligned.  The host endian format is typically used - compatibility is
 * possible if the implementation detects reversed endian and adjusts accesses
 * accordingly.
 *
 * HAMMER2 primarily revolves around the directory topology:  inodes,
 * directory entries, and block tables.  Block device buffer cache buffers
 * are always 64KB.  Logical file buffers are typically 16KB.  All data
 * references utilize 64-bit byte offsets.
 *
 * Free block management is handled independently using blocks reserved by
 * the media topology.
 */

/*
 * The data at the end of a file or directory may be a fragment in order
 * to optimize storage efficiency.  The minimum fragment size is 1KB.
 * Since allocations are in powers of 2 fragments must also be sized in
 * powers of 2 (1024, 2048, ... 65536).
 *
 * For the moment the maximum allocation size is HAMMER2_PBUFSIZE (64K),
 * which is 2^16.  Larger extents may be supported in the future.  Smaller
 * fragments might be supported in the future (down to 64 bytes is possible),
 * but probably will not be.
 *
 * A full indirect block use supports 512 x 128-byte blockrefs in a 64KB
 * buffer.  Indirect blocks down to 1KB are supported to keep small
 * directories small.
 *
 * A maximally sized file (2^64-1 bytes) requires ~6 indirect block levels
 * using 64KB indirect blocks (128 byte refs, 512 or radix 9 per indblk).
 *
 *	16(datablk) + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = ~70.
 *	16(datablk) + 7 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = ~68.  (smaller top level indblk)
 *
 * The actual depth depends on copies redundancy and whether the filesystem
 * has chosen to use a smaller indirect block size at the top level or not.

 * ==========
 *
 * The first four 2GB zones contain volume headers and volume header backups.
 * After that the volume header block# is reserved for future use.  Similarly,
 * there are many blocks related to various Freemap levels which are not
 * used in every segment and those are also reserved for future use.
 * Note that each FREEMAP_LEAF or FREEMAP_NODE uses 32KB out of 64KB slot.
 *
 *			Freemap (see the FREEMAP document)
 *
 * The freemap utilizes blocks #1-40 in 8 sets of 5 blocks.  Each block in
 * a set represents a level of depth in the freemap topology.  Eight sets
 * exist to prevent live updates from disturbing the state of the freemap
 * were a crash/reboot to occur.  That is, a live update is not committed
 * until the update's flush reaches the volume root.  There are FOUR volume
 * roots representing the last four synchronization points, so the freemap
 * must be consistent no matter which volume root is chosen by the mount
 * code.
 *
 * Each freemap set is 5 x 64K blocks and represents the 1GB, 256GB, 64TB,
 * 16PB and 4EB indirect map.  The volume header itself has a set of 4 freemap
 * blockrefs representing another 2 bits, giving us a total 64 bits of
 * representable address space.
 *
 * The Level 0 64KB block represents 1GB of storage represented by 32KB
 * (256 x struct hammer2_bmap_data).  Each structure represents 4MB of storage
 * and has a 512 bit bitmap, using 2 bits to represent a 16KB chunk of
 * storage.  These 2 bits represent the following states:
 *
 *	00	Free
 *	01	(reserved) (Possibly partially allocated)
 *	10	Possibly free
 *	11	Allocated
 *
 * One important thing to note here is that the freemap resolution is 16KB,
 * but the minimum storage allocation size is 1KB.  The hammer2 vfs keeps
 * track of sub-allocations in memory, which means that on a unmount or reboot
 * the entire 16KB of a partially allocated block will be considered fully
 * allocated.  It is possible for fragmentation to build up over time, but
 * defragmentation is fairly easy to accomplish since all modifications
 * allocate a new block.
 *
 * The Second thing to note is that due to the way snapshots and inode
 * replication works, deleting a file cannot immediately free the related
 * space.  Furthermore, deletions often do not bother to traverse the
 * block subhierarchy being deleted.  And to go even further, whole
 * sub-directory trees can be deleted simply by deleting the directory inode
 * at the top.  So even though we have a symbol to represent a 'possibly free'
 * block (binary 10), only the bulk free scanning code can actually use it.
 * Normal 'rm's or other deletions do not.
 *
 * WARNING!  ZONE_SEG and VOLUME_ALIGN must be a multiple of 1<<LEVEL0_RADIX
 *	     (i.e. a multiple of 4MB).  VOLUME_ALIGN must be >= ZONE_SEG.
 *
 * In Summary:
 *
 * (1) Modifications to freemap blocks 'allocate' a new copy (aka use a block
 *     from the next set).  The new copy is reused until a flush occurs at
 *     which point the next modification will then rotate to the next set.

 * The media block reference structure.  This forms the core of the HAMMER2
 * media topology recursion.  This 128-byte data structure is embedded in the
 * volume header, in inodes (which are also directory entries), and in
 * indirect blocks.
 *
 * A blockref references a single media item, which typically can be a
 * directory entry (aka inode), indirect block, or data block.
 *
 * The primary feature a blockref represents is the ability to validate
 * the entire tree underneath it via its check code.  Any modification to
 * anything propagates up the blockref tree all the way to the root, replacing
 * the related blocks and compounding the generated check code.
 *
 * The check code can be a simple 32-bit iscsi code, a 64-bit crc, or as
 * complex as a 512 bit cryptographic hash.  I originally used a 64-byte
 * blockref but later expanded it to 128 bytes to be able to support the
 * larger check code as well as to embed statistics for quota operation.
 *
 * Simple check codes are not sufficient for unverified dedup.  Even with
 * a maximally-sized check code unverified dedup should only be used in
 * subdirectory trees where you do not need 100% data integrity.
 *
 * Unverified dedup is deduping based on meta-data only without verifying
 * that the data blocks are actually identical.  Verified dedup guarantees
 * integrity but is a far more I/O-expensive operation.

 *	 within the topology across all cluster nodes (when fully

 *
 * NOTE: The range of keys represented by the blockref is (key) to

 *
 * A smaller allocation granularity is supported via a linear iterator and/or

 *	     used to sub-allocate within the 16KB block (which is already

 *
 *	     Typically integrated with the blockref type in the upper 8 bits
 *	     to localize inodes and indrect blocks, improving bulk free scans

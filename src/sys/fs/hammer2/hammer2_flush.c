 *
 * (3) Recursively flush live children (rbtree).  This can create deferrals.

 *     and typically causes the parent to be marked MODIFIED as the children
 *     update the parent's block table.  A parent might already be marked
 *     MODIFIED due to a deletion (whos blocktable update in the parent is

 *
 * (4) Permanently disconnected sub-trees are cleaned up by the front-end.

 *     filesystem syncer.
 *
 * (5) Delete parents on the way back up if they are normal indirect blocks
 *     and have no children.

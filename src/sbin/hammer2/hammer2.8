.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides miscellaneous support functions for a
HAMMER2 file system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl s Ar path
Specify the path to a mounted HAMMER2 filesystem.
At least one PFS on a HAMMER2 filesystem must be mounted for the system
to act on all PFSs managed by it.
Every HAMMER2 filesystem typically has a PFS called "LOCAL" for this purpose.
.It Fl t Ar type
Specify the type when creating, upgrading, or downgrading a PFS.
Supported types are MASTER, SLAVE, SOFT_MASTER, SOFT_SLAVE, CACHE, and DUMMY.
If not specified the pfs-create directive will default to MASTER if no
UUID is specified, and SLAVE if a UUID is specified.
.It Fl u Ar uuid
Specify the cluster UUID when creating a PFS.
If not specified, a unique, random UUID will be generated.
Note that every PFS also has a unique pfs_id which is always generated
and cannot be overridden with an option.
The { pfs_clid, pfs_fsid } tuple uniquely identifies a component of a cluster.
.It Fl m Ar mem
Specify how much tracking memory to use for certain directives.
At the moment, this option is only applicable to the
.Cm bulkfree
directive, allowing it to operate in fewer passes when given more memory.
A nominal value for a 4TB drive with a ton of stuff on it would be around
a gigabyte '-m 1g'.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
directives are as shown below.
Note that most directives require you to either be CD'd into a hammer2
filesystem, specify a path to a mounted hammer2 filesystem via the
.Fl s
option, or specify a path after the directive.
It depends on the directive.
All hammer2 filesystems have a PFS called "LOCAL" which is typically mounted
locally on the host in order to be able to issue commands for other PFSs
on the filesystem.
The mount also enables PFS configuration scanning for that filesystem.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\" ==== cleanup ====
.It Cm cleanup Op path
Perform manual cleanup passes on paths or all mounted partitions.
.\" ==== destroy ====
.It Cm destroy Ar path...
Destroy the specified directory entry in a hammer2 filesystem.
This bypasses
all normal checks and will unconditionally destroy the directory entry.
The underlying inode is not checked and, if it does exist, its nlinks count
is not decremented.
This directive should only be used to destroy a corrupted directory entry
which no longer has a working inode.
Unsupported unless HAMMER2_INVARIANTS is enabled.
.Pp
Note that this command may desynchronize the system namecache for the
specified entry.
If this happens, you may have to unmount and remount the filesystem.
.\" ==== destroy-inum ====
.It Cm destroy-inum Ar path...
Destroy the specified inode in a hammer2 filesystem.
Unsupported unless HAMMER2_INVARIANTS is enabled.
.\" ==== emergency-mode-enable ===
.It Cm emergency-mode-enable Ar target
Flag emergency operations mode in the filesystem.
This mode may be used
as a last resort to delete files and directories from a full filesystem.
Inode creation, file writes, and certain meta-data cleanups are disallowed
while emergency mode is active.
File and directory removal and mode/attr setting is still allowed.
This mode is extremely dangerous and should only be used as a last resort.
.Pp
This mode allows the filesystem to modify blocks in-place when it is unable
to allocate a copy.
Thus it is possible to chflags and remove files and
directories even when the filesystem is completely full.
However, there is a price.
This mode of operation WILL LIKELY CORRUPT ANY SNAPSHOTS related
to this filesystem.
The filesystem will report this condition if it encounters
it but if you are forced to use this mode to fix a filesystem full condition
your snapshots can get a bit dicey.
It is usually safest to delete any related snapshots when using this mode.
.Pp
You can detect whether related snapshots have been corrupted by running
a bulkfree pass and checking the console output for reported CRC errors.
If no errors are reported, your snapshots are fine.
If errors are reported
you should delete related snapshots until bulkfree reports no further errors.
.Pp
The emergency mode will also make meta-data updates unsafe due to the lack of
copy-on-write, causing potential harm if the system unexpectedly panics or
loses power.
GREAT CARE MUST BE TAKEN WHILE THIS MODE IS ACTIVE.
.Bl -enum
.It
Determine that you are unable to recover space with normal file and directory
removal commands due to
.Er ENOSPC
errors being returned by 'rm', or through the
removal of snapshots (if any).  The 'bulkfree' directive must be issued to
scan the filesystem and free up the actual space, then check with 'df'.
Continue if you still have insufficient space and are unable to remove items
normally.
.It
If you need any related snapshots, this is a good time to copy them elsewhere.
.It
Idle or kill any processes trying to use the filesystem.
.It
Issue the emergency-mode-enable directive on the filesystem.
Once enabled, run 'sync' to update any dirty inodes which may still
be dirty due to not being able to flush.
Please remember that this
directive is a LAST RESORT, is dangerous, and will likely corrupt any
other snapshots you have based on the filesystem you are removing files
from.
.It
Remove file trees as necessary with 'rm -rf' to free space, being cognizant
of any warnings issued by the kernel on the console (via 'dmesg') while
doing so.
.It
Issue the 'bulkfree' directive to actually free the space and check that
sufficient space has been freed with 'df'.
.It
If bulkfree reports CHECK errors, or if you have snapshots and insufficient
space has been freed, you will need to delete snapshots.
Re-run bulkfree and delete snapshots until no errors are reported.
.It
Issue the emergency-mode-disable directive when done.
It might also be a
good idea to reboot after using this mode, but theoretically you should not
have to.
.It
Restore services using the filesystem.
.El
.\" ==== emergency-mode-disable ===
.It Cm emergency-mode-disable Ar target
Turn off the emergency operations mode on a filesystem, restoring normal
operation.
.\" ==== growfs ====
.It Cm growfs Op fspath...
After resizing the disk partition you can issue this command on a
mounted hammer2 filesystem to grow into the new space in the partition.
This command is run on a live hammer2 filesystem.
.\" ==== hash ====
.It Cm hash Op filename...
Compute and print the directory hash for any number of filenames.
.\" ==== dhash ====
.It Cm dhash Op filename...
Compute and print the data hash for long directory entry for any number of
filenames.
.\" ==== pfs-list ====
.It Cm pfs-list Op path...
List all PFSs associated with all mounted hammer2 storage devices.
The list may be restricted to a particular filesystem using
.Fl s Ar mount .
.Pp
Note that hammer2 PFSs associated with storage devices which have not been
mounted in any fashion will not be listed.
At least one hammer2 label must be mounted for the PFSs on that device to be
visible.
.\" ==== pfs-clid ====
.It Cm pfs-clid Ar label
Print the cluster id for a PFS specified by name.
.\" ==== pfs-fsid ====
.It Cm pfs-fsid Ar label
Print the unique filesystem id for a PFS specified by name.
.\" ==== pfs-create ====
.It Cm pfs-create Ar label
Create a local PFS on the mounted HAMMER2 filesystem represented
by the current directory, or specified via
.Fl s Ar mount .
If no UUID is specified the pfs-type defaults to MASTER.
If a UUID is specified via the
.Fl u
option the pfs-type defaults to SLAVE.
Other types can be specified with the
.Fl t
option.
.Pp
If you wish to add a MASTER to an existing cluster, you must first add it as
a SLAVE and then upgrade it to MASTER to properly synchronize it.
.Pp
The DUMMY pfs-type is used to tie network-accessible clusters into the local
machine when no local storage is desired.
This type should be used on minimal H2 partitions or entirely in ram for
netboot-centric systems to provide a tie-in point for the mount command,
or on more complex systems where you need to also access network-centric
clusters.
.Pp
The CACHE or SLAVE pfs-type is typically used when the main store is on
the network but local storage is desired to improve performance.
SLAVE is also used when a backup is desired.
.Pp
Generally speaking, you can mount any PFS element of a cluster in order to
access the cluster via the full cluster protocol.
There are two exceptions.
If you mount a SOFT_SLAVE or a SOFT_MASTER then soft quorum semantics are
employed... the soft slave or soft master's current state will always be used
and the quorum protocol will not be used.
The soft PFS will still be
synchronized to masters in the background when available.
Also, you can use
.Sq mount -o local
to mount ONLY a local HAMMER2 PFS and
not run any network or quorum protocols for the mount.
All such mounts except for a SOFT_MASTER mount will be read-only.
Other than that, you will be mounting the whole cluster when you mount any
PFS within the cluster.
.Pp
DUMMY - Create a PFS skeleton intended to be the mount point for a
more complex cluster, probably one that is entirely network based.
No data will be synchronized to this PFS so it is suitable for use
in a network boot image or memory filesystem.
This allows you to create placeholders for mount points on your local
disk, SSD, or memory disk.
.Pp
CACHE - Create a PFS for caching portions of the cluster piecemeal.
This is similar to a SLAVE but does not synchronize the entire contents of
the cluster to the PFS.
Elements found in the CACHE PFS which are validated against the cluster
will be read, presumably a faster access than having to go to the cluster.
Only local CACHEs will be updated.
Network-accessible CACHE PFSs might be read but will not be written to.
If you have a large hard-drive-based cluster you can set up localized
SSD CACHE PFSs to improve performance.
.Pp
SLAVE - Create a PFS which maintains synchronization with and provides a
read-only copy of the cluster.
HAMMER2 will prioritize local SLAVEs for data retrieval after validating
their transaction id against the cluster.
The difference between a CACHE and a SLAVE is that the SLAVE is synchronized
to a full copy of the cluster and thus can serve as a backup or be staged
for use as a MASTER later on.
.Pp
SOFT_SLAVE - Create a PFS which maintains synchronization with and provides
a read-only copy of the cluster.
This is one of the special mount cases.
A SOFT_SLAVE will synchronize with
the cluster when the cluster is available, but can still be accessed when
the cluster is not available.
.Pp
MASTER - Create a PFS which will hold a master copy of the cluster.
If you create several MASTER PFSs with the same cluster id you are
effectively creating a multi-master cluster and causing a quorum and
cache coherency protocol to be used to validate operations.
The total number of masters is stored in each PFSs making up the cluster.
Filesystem operations will stall for normal mounts if a quorum cannot be
obtained to validate the operation.
MASTER nodes which go offline and return later will synchronize in the
background.
Note that when adding a MASTER to an existing cluster you must add the
new PFS as a SLAVE and then upgrade it to a MASTER.
.Pp
SOFT_MASTER - Create a PFS which maintains synchronization with and provides
a read-write copy of the cluster.
This is one of the special mount cases.
A SOFT_MASTER will synchronize with
the cluster when the cluster is available, but can still be read AND written
to even when the cluster is not available.
Modifications made to a SOFT_MASTER will be automatically flushed to the
cluster when it becomes accessible again, and vise-versa.
Manual intervention may be required if a conflict occurs during
synchronization.
.\" ==== pfs-delete ====
.It Cm pfs-delete Op label...
Destroy a PFS by name.
All hammer2 mount points will be checked, however this directive will refuse to
delete a PFS whos name is duplicated on multiple mount points.
A specific mount point may be specified to restrict the deletion via the
.Fl s Ar mount
option.
.\" ==== recover ====
.It Cm recover Ar media Ar path Ar destdir
Recover a file or directory tree by scanning the raw media partition,
with minimal requirements for an intact topology.  The results are written
to the destination directory.
.Pp
The recovery path can be anchored at (any) root by prefixing it with a "/".
If not anchored, any matching sub-tree will be recovered and combined into
one place on the destination (not as separate sub-trees since that requires
topological knowledge that might not be available).  Roots include all
PFS roots and snapshot roots, as well as disconnected roots from COW updates
(aka to be able to undelete a file or directory sub-tree).
.Pp
The path may specify a directory or file to restore.  Note that if you
specify something like ".cshrc", then all ".cshrc" files found in the
entire filesystem will be recovered.  Multiple references to the same
physical inode with the same filename in the same directory are filtered out.
.Pp
This function is meant for catastrophic recovery or corrupted media or
recovery for deleted files that are not otherwise available in snapshots.
All possible versions of files will be recovered and suffixed as "*.%05d"
with an iterator.
.Pp
The hammer2 recovery function is not meant to generate a fully operational
filesystem in the target directory.  All files will be versioned and contain
iteration suffixes.  Many files and sub-directory trees may wind up glommed
together in one place.  However, this function will recover mtime, ownership,
group, modes, and flags.  Recovered files are fully validated and any missing
data will cause the file to be renamed with a ".corrupted" suffix.
.Pp
Memory requirements - This function needs to track inodes and paths and
can eat a considerable amount of ram, and it tends to be random-access
so while swap can make ends meet, it might slow the scan down drastically
if it has to eat into it much.
Ram consumption scales with the number of inodes found.  Call it a few
gigabytes up to 500GB of media and approaching 64GB on busy 4TB media.
Busy meaning, say, 50 million topological inodes turning into 1 billion
inodes located by the media scan.
.\" ==== recover-relaxed ====
.It Cm recover-relaxed Ar media Ar path Ar destdir
This version of the recover directive relaxes bref checks.  Under normal
operation, only brefs with check codes are allowed because we get too many
false hits otherwise.  In relaxed mode, bref's with the check code disabled
are also allowed.
.Pp
You should only need to use the relaxed version if you have turned off
CRCs on the files you want to recover.
.\" ==== recover-file ====
.It Cm recover-file Ar media Ar path Ar destdir
This version of recover is the normal strict-mode recover but explicitly
indicates that the path being recovered is a regular file and not a
directory.  Prevents junk recursions when entries corresponding to the
last path element appear to be directories.
.\" ==== snapshot ====
.It Cm snapshot Ar path Op label
Create a snapshot of a directory.
The snapshot will be created on the same hammer2 storage device as the
directory.
This can only be used on a local PFS, and is only really useful if the PFS
contains a complete copy of what you desire to snapshot so that typically
means a local MASTER, SOFT_MASTER, SLAVE, or SOFT_SLAVE must be present.
Snapshots are created simply by flushing a PFS mount to disk and then copying
the directory inode to the PFS.
The topology is snapshotted without having to be copied or scanned and
take no additional space.
However, bulkfree scans may take longer.
Snapshots are effectively separate from the cluster they came from
and can be used as a starting point for a new cluster.
So unless you build a new cluster from the snapshot, it will stay local
to the machine it was made on.
.Pp
Snapshots can be maintained automatically with
.Xr periodic 8 .
See
.Xr periodic.conf 5
for details of enabling and configuring the functionality.
.\" ==== snapshot-debug ====
.It Cm snapshot-debug Ar path Op label
Snapshot without filesystem sync.
.\" ==== stat ====
.It Cm stat Op path...
Print the inode statistics, compression, and other meta-data associated
with a list of paths.
.\" ==== show ====
.It Cm show Ar devpath
Dump the radix tree for the HAMMER2 filesystem by scanning a
block device directly.
No mount is required.
.\" ==== freemap ====
.It Cm freemap Ar devpath
Dump the freemap tree for the HAMMER2 filesystem by scanning a
block device directly.
No mount is required.
.\" ==== volhdr ====
.It Cm volhdr Ar devpath
Dump the volume header for the HAMMER2 filesystem by scanning a
block device directly.
No mount is required.
.\" ==== volume-list ====
.It Cm volume-list Op path...
List all volumes associated with all mounted hammer2 storage devices.
The list may be restricted to a particular filesystem using
.Fl s Ar mount .
.Pp
Note that hammer2 volumes associated with storage devices which have not been
mounted in any fashion will not be listed.
At least one hammer2 label must be mounted for the volumes on that device to be
visible.
.\" ==== setcomp ====
.It Cm setcomp Ar mode[:level] Ar path...
Set the compression mode as specified for any newly created elements at or
under the path if not overridden by deeper elements.
Available modes are none, autozero, lz4, or zlib.
When zlib is used the compression level can be set.
The default will be 6 which is the best trade-off between performance and
time.
.Pp
newfs_hammer2 will set the default compression to lz4 which prioritizes
speed over performance.
Also note that HAMMER2 contains a heuristic and will not attempt to
compress every block if it detects a sufficient amount of uncompressable
data.
.Pp
Hammer2 compression is only effective when it can reduce the size of dataset
(typically a 64KB block) by one or more powers of 2.  A 64K block which
only compresses to 40K will not yield any storage improvement.
.Pp
Generally speaking you do not want to set the compression mode to
.Sq none ,
as this will cause blocks of all-zeros to be written as all-zero blocks,
instead of holes.
The
.Sq autozero
compression mode detects blocks of all-zeros
and writes them as holes.
.\" ==== setcheck ====
.It Cm setcheck Ar check Ar path...
Set the check code as specified for any newly created elements at or under
the path if not overridden by deeper elements.
Available codes are default, disabled, crc32, xxhash64, or sha192.
.Pp
Normally HAMMER2 does not overwrite data blocks on the media in order to ensure
snapshot integrity.
Replacement data blocks will be reallocated.
However, if the compression mode is set to
.Sq none
and the check code is set to
.Sq disabled
HAMMER2 will overwrite data on the media in-place.
In this mode of operation,
snapshots will not be able to snapshot the data against later changes
made to the file, and de-duplication will no longer function on any
data related to the file.
However, you can still recover the most recent data from previously
taken snapshots if you accidentally remove the file.
.\" ==== clrcheck ====
.It Cm clrcheck Op path...
Clear the check code override for the specified paths.
Overrides may still be present in deeper elements.
.\" ==== setcrc32 ====
.It Cm setcrc32 Op path...
Set the check code to the ISCSI 32-bit CRC for any newly created elements
at or under the path if not overridden by deeper elements.
.\" ==== setxxhash64 ====
.It Cm setxxhash64 Op path...
Set the check code to XXHASH64, a fast 64-bit hash.
.\" ==== setsha192 ====
.It Cm setsha192 Op path...
Set the check code to SHA192 for any newly created elements at or under
the path if not overridden by deeper elements.
.\" ==== bulkfree ====
.It Cm bulkfree Ar path
Run a bulkfree pass on a HAMMER2 mount.
You can specify any PFS for the mount, the bulkfree pass is run on the
entire partition.
Note that it takes two passes to actually free space.
By default this directive will use up to 1/16 physical memory to track
the freemap.
The amount of memory used may be overridden with the
.Op Fl m Ar mem
option.
.\" ==== printinode ====
.It Cm printinode Ar path
Dump inode.
.\" ==== dumpchain ====
.It Cm dumpchain Op path Op chnflags
Dump in-memory chain topology.
Unsupported unless HAMMER2_INVARIANTS is enabled.
.El
.Sh SYSCTLS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va vfs.hammer2.dedup_enable "(default on)"
Enables live de-duplication.
Any recently read data that is on-media
(already synchronized to media) is tested against pending writes for
compatibility.
If a match is found, the write will reference the
existing on-media data instead of writing new data.
.It Va vfs.hammer2.always_compress "(default off)"
This disables the H2 compression heuristic and forces H2 to always
try to compress data blocks, even if they look uncompressable.
Enabling this option reduces performance but has higher de-duplication
repeatability.
.It Va vfs.hammer2.bulkfree_tps "(default 5000)"
Set bulkfree's maximum scan rate.
This is primarily intended to limit
I/O utilization on SSDs and CPU utilization when the meta-data is mostly
cached in memory.
